## Why Database?

#### What are the problem with everything stored in files?

Redundancies(repeat) and inconsistencies

Data isolation

Integrity problem

Concurrent access by multiple users

## Basic Definitions

#### Database Management System(DBMS):

A software package/ system to facilitate the creation and maintenance of a computerized database.

#### Database System:

The DBMS software together with the data itself.

## Database Approach:

##### Main characteristics of the Database Approach:

1. Self-describing nature of a database system

2. Insulation between programs and data:

     Called  program-data independence.

     Allows changing data structures and storage organization without having to change the DBMS access programs.

3. Sharing of data and multi-user transaction processing



Advantages of Using the db approach:

Controlling redundancy in date storage and in develop and maintenance efforts.

Regulation authority. Only the DBA has privilege.

Providing storage structure for efficient query processing.

Enforcing integrity constraints on the database.
